## How it works!

### üöÄ How did I find out where the ISS is?
[![post iss location](./assets/post-iss-location.png)](./server/server.js)
[![fetch iss location](./assets/fetch-iss-location.png)](./client/src/lib/fetch-iss-location.js)
It fetches the data from the ISS location API, gets the latitude and longitude and sends that off to the front end. I don't use the ISS API directly on the front-end as this would cause a CORS error.

## üåç How did I make the 3D globe background?
[![the globe](./assets/globe-background.png)](./client/src/lib/render-background.js)
Using ThreeJS I create a scene and camera, and then render a red wireframe sphere on the page. Using the [requestAnimationFrame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestAnimationFrame) method, which calls its callback every frame tick, I animate the globe rotating.

## üï∫ How do I display the map?
[![fancy map](./assets/draw-map.png)](./client/src/lib/draw-map.js)
After I've gotten the location of the ISS from the ISS API I input its latitude and longitude into a drawMap function I created. This function uses [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) with [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) to draw a map on screen and then pan to the location of the ISS.
